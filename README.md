# Squarevival
Squarevival is a game heavily inspired by Minecraft by Mojang Studios I've been working on.

## Things I want to fix
-Going to the bottom edge of the world crashes the game

-The game crashes when you try to move an item in the inventory

-The game is laggier when there are more items in the inventory

-The tiles don't show near the world's edges

-Walking diagonally into objects lets you walk through them
