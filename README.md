# Squarevival
Squarevival is a game heavily inspired by Minecraft by Mojang Studios I've been working on.

## Keybinds
Move up                 | W

Move down               | S

Move left               | A

Move right              | D

Destroy tile            | Left Click

Select Item             | 1-8

Open inventory          | E

Open debug screen       | Q

## Things I want to fix
-Going to the bottom edge of the world crashes the game

-The game is laggier when you have more items in your inventory

-Walking diagonally into objects lets you walk through them
